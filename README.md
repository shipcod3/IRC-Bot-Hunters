# IRC Bot Hunters
a collection of Metasploit PoC exploits for IRC Botnets that takes over the owner of a bot which then allows Remote Code Execution. Most IRC Botnets can be taken over by using their herders' usernames or by triggering a certain command which does shell execution. Almost all of the modules here have been accepted in the Metasploit repository. If you are looking for C&C exploit modules or pwning backdoors like r57 / c99 shell, I have also made some modules which I have pushed in the main msf repository.

# Request for Metasploit Modules?
Want an IRC bot pwned or you have an exploit for an IRC bot that you want to be ported to msf? Contact me at shipcodez@gmail.com

I am always open for suggestions and new modules as long as you give me details and analysis of a new IRC bot in the wild. Save the world from cavities!!!
